            All submissions must use the

            found <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">here</a>.
            LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (sigconf option),
            with the default 9-pt font size in two-column format.
            This format will be used also for the camera-ready version of accepted papers.

            Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication.
            Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions.
            Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed.
            We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the
            conference submission system.
