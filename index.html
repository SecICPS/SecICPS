            <h5>WELCOME To SecICPS 2020!</h5>

            <p class="lead">
                The SecICPS 2020 workshop is scheduled on November 16, 2020 and will be held online.
            </p>

            <p> Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), sensing, communication,
                computation and storage techniques have improved the way CPS interact,
                exchange and process information. Especially, in recent years, Intelligent Cyber-Physical System (ICPS),
                such as unmanned vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and robots,
                have emerged for various applications without surveillance by human.
                Yet, the success, prosperity and advancement of these intelligent systems strongly depend on the security
                and safety of the cyber-physical devices, system software, and application software.
                These systems are prone to suffering from various security and safety issues, such as hardware defects,
                system and application vulnerabilities, network eavesdropping, side-channel attacks
                and so on. These successful attacks targeted to the Intelligent CPS do not only affect
                the security of information but also the safety of system, which may lead to malfunction
                of systems with severe financial, environmental and health losses. The goal of the 2020
                SecICPS workshop is to bring together internationally leading academic and industrial
                researchers in an effort to identify and discuss the major technical challenges and recent
                results to meet the security and safety requirements of future ICPS’s applications in
                various fields.</p>
            <p> We solicit high quality position papers and research papers that address
                opportunities and challenges at the areas of hardware security, intelligent system
                security, application security and network security. We welcome contributions to all
                relevant research on attacks on ICPS, hardware protections, secure software modelling
                and verification, security and safety analysis, network security and so on.</p>

                <p>The topics of interest include, but are by no means limited
                to:</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li>Attacks on ICPS including spoofing, eavesdropping, side-channel attack and so on</li>
                <li>Adversarial machine learning on ICPS</li>
