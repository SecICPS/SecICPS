<p>	
	<p>Complementing the topics of <a href='http://sensys.acm.org/2019/'>ACM SenSys 2019</a>, this workshop will bring researchers together to explore the challenges, issues and opportunities in the research, design, and engineering of energy-harvesting, energy-neutral and intermittent sensing systems. These are an enabling technology for future applications in smart energy, transportation, environmental monitoring and smart cities. Innovative solutions in hardware for energy scavenging, adaptive algorithms, and power management policies are needed to enable either uninterrupted and intermittent operation.<br><br>
		
		High quality technical articles are solicited, describing advances in sensing systems powered by energy harvesting, aswell as those which describe practical deployments and implementation experiences.</p><p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Power management concepts, algorithms and circuits for energy-harvesting sensing systems
				<li>Hardware and software concepts, algorithms and circuits for intermittent computing
				<li>Middleware and services supporting interoperability between zero-energy networks
				<li>Resource management and operating system support for energy-harvesting sensing systems
				<li>Network-wide distributed energy management (e.g. routing, adaptive duty cycling, etc.)
				<li>Communication in intermittent-power domain
				<li>Online measurement of energy intake and consumption
				<li>Predicting energy intake and consumption
				<li>Ensuring reliable operation in energy-harvesting sensor systems
				<li>Modelling, simulation and tools for effective design of future energy harvesting sensing systems
				<li>Architectures and standards for energy-neutral, powerneutral or intermittent sensing systems
				<li>Internet of (battery-less) things
				<li>Experience with real-world deployments and innovative applications
			</ul></p><p>We solicit three types of paper submission:<br><ul><li><b>Technical Papers:</b> up to 6 pages (including everything except references), reporting on novel research, to be presented at the workshop as an oral presentation;<li><b>Position Papers</b> up to 3 pages (including everything), reporting on new research directions and/or a controversial debate of past research, to be presented at the workshop as a short pitch with interactive discussion;<li><b>Demo/Poster Papers</b> up to 2 pages (including everything), to be presented at the workshop as an interactive demonstration or poster respectively.</ul><br> Submissions should be previously unpublished, and not currently under review by another conference or journal. Papers should be submitted for consideration via the workshop website, prior to the submission deadline, and must adhere to the provided formatting guidelines. Papers will undergo double-blind review, authors are asked to remove their names and other identifying statements from submissions by:<br><br><ol><li>using the 'anonymous' option for the class, and<li>using 'anonsuppress' section where appropriate.</ol><br>Submissions will be reviewed for novelty, relevance and quality. Accepted papers will be available on the <b>ACM Digital Library</b> on the first day of the conference.<br><br><p style='font-size: 120%; text-align: center;'><b>All papers should be submitted through <a href='https://enssys19.hotcrp.com/'>HotCRP</a></b></p></p>
