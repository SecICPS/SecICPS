            <p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), sensing, communication, computation and storage techniques have improved the way CPS interact, 
                exchange and process information. Especially in recent years, Intelligent Cyber-Physical System (ICPS), 
                such as unmanned vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and robots, have emerged for various applications without surveillance by human.
                Yet, the success, prosperity, and advancement of these intelligent systems strongly depend on the security and safety of the cyber-physical devices, 
                system software, and application software. These systems are prone to suffering from various security and safety issues, such as hardware defects, 
                system and application vulnerabilities, network eavesdropping, side-channel attacks and so on. These successful attacks targeted to the Intelligent 
                CPS do not only affect the security of information but also the safety of system, which may lead to malfunction of systems with severe financial, 
                environmental and health losses.The goal of the 2020 SecICPS workshop is to bring together internationally leading academic and industrial researchers 
                in an effort to identify and discuss the major technical challenges and recent results to meet the security and safety requirements of future 
                ICPS’s applications in various fields.

            <p class="lead">Planned Format</p>
            <p>SecICPS 2020 will be a <strong>full-day</strong> workshop. We are expecting somewhere between <strong>30-50 people</strong> for the workshop. 
                The tentative plan is to have two keynote talks and 3 technical 
                sessions comprising of 9 papers including technical and short papers. </p>

            <p>We solicit three types of paper submission:</p>
            <!--
      <p>This year HotWeb will feature a <b>Best Paper Award</b> and a
      <b>Best Student Paper Award</b>.
-->
            <ul>
            <li><p> <strong>Technical Papers</strong>: up to 6 pages (including everything except references), reporting on novel research, 
                to be presented at the workshop as an oral presentation; <p> </li> 
            <li><p> <strong>Short Papers</strong>: up to 3 pages (including everything), reporting on new research directions and/or a controversial 
                debate of past research, to be presented at the workshop as a short pitch with interactive discussion; </p></li>
            <li><p> <strong>Poster Papers</strong>: up to 2 pages (including everything), to be presented at the workshop as a poster.</p> </li> 
            </ul>
